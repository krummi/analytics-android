analytics-android
=================

This is OZ's fork of the [Segment.io](https://segment.io) Android library which we have adapted to fit our needs. This library is designed to communicate with our analytics event engine (analytics_z) even though the changes from the original library are minimal and mainly consist of the following alterations:

* Endpoints have been updated. [Commit](https://github.com/ozinc/analytics-android/commit/8b03a099bfa9dce82a4b800640d4481be92e2b92).  
* All bundled libraries have been removed. [Commit](https://github.com/ozinc/analytics-android/commit/d00587788353b06b7940a802fe15be95a3c7f599). 
* Consequently, all providers have been removed. [Same commit](https://github.com/ozinc/analytics-android/commit/d00587788353b06b7940a802fe15be95a3c7f599).
* Hacky workaround has been added to prevent the library from using the SegmentIO's settings endpoint. [Commit](https://github.com/ozinc/analytics-android/commit/a8920e3ce08dd2329e64f174a306595f5000b69b).
* Gradleized. Commits [#1](https://github.com/ozinc/analytics-android/commit/b1b236ba527f02746f3b335d1ff1635f8ed86aea) and [#2](https://github.com/ozinc/analytics-android/commit/8b03a099bfa9dce82a4b800640d4481be92e2b92).

The only item in the aforementioned list that is not fairly self-explanatory is the settings hack. The problems here is that the original SegmentIO library contacts their REST API via the settings endpoint to retrieve data on which providers are enabled and which are not. As we have removed all of the providers we don't want this to happen.
